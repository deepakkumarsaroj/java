    Java is a high level , Object-Oriented Programming language.

    Java was developed by Sun-microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle) in 1995.
    Before Java it was named as Oak.

    James Gosling is known as the father of Java.

    High Level language => it is easy to understand,debug,portable,do not depend on machines and are widely used .
    Low Level language => machine friendly , not portable and difficult to understand .

              

                 History of Java
    James Gosling and his team was working to develop a language for television industry in 1995.
    Gosling worked om this project with his team that is called Green team and the project is called Greentalk.
    Here comes the rise of Java.
    Initially it was named as Oak as per roots of Oak was outside the office of Gosling.
    

                 Features of Java 

     Simple
     Portable
     Robust
     Object-Oriented
     Multithreaded
     Secured
     Platform-Independent
     Interpreted
     Dynamic
     High Performance 



                 Applications of Java

    1. Standalone Applications => Desktop applications , window-based applications. ex:- media-player,antivirus
    2. Web Applications => Runs on server side and creates a dynamic page . ex:- servlet,jsp
    3. Enterprise Applications => distributed in nature. ex:- EJB
    4. Mobile Applications => mobile devices. ex:- Android



                Comments in Java
    
    1. Single Line Comment => //
    2. Multiline Comment =>  /* ..........*/
    3. Documentation Comment => /** ..........*/



                   JVM > JRE > JDK

                   Java program is converted into Java bytecodes which is then translated by JVM into machine codes
                   which can be then understood by the CPU to get the output .

    1. Java Virtual machine (JVM) -> Virtual machine that provides a runtime environment to execute java bytecodes.
                                     it doesn't exist physically.

    2. Java Runtime Environment -> provides java libraries and other files to run java 
                                   it exists physically

    3. Java Development Kit -> superset of JRE and creates java applications
                               1.Java Enterprise Edition
                               2.Java Standard Edition
                               3.Java Mobile Edition
